Small business owners who utilized the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) can apply for loan forgiveness on eligible expenditures. PPP forgiveness requires applying through the Small Business Administration (SBA) online portal or individual lender.

Loan forgiveness is the process by which a lender discharges a borrowerâ€™s obligation to repay their loan. Depending on the loan and nature of the cancellation, some or all of the outstanding loan balance may be forgiven. This is in contrast to grant money, which generally does not require repayment even in the absence of express forgiveness.

In the context of PPP loans, borrowers are eligible for loan forgiveness if they use the funds to cover designated expenses.

Covid EIDLs are not forgivable and must be repaid in full. Borrowers can, however, take advantage of a 30-month payment deferral period that begins on the date of the note. This deferral period applies to loans approved in 2020, 2021 and 2022, and is an extension of the original 12-month deferment.
